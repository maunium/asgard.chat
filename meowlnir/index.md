# Getting started with Meowlnir

Meowlnir doesn't currently create management rooms automatically, so you'll be
asked to create one as a part of the application process and provide the room
ID. After the application is accepted, you can invite the bot to the room.

Once the bot is joined, you can use the `!help` command to view a full list of
available commands. Refer to the Meowlnir docs for actually subscribing to
policy lists and protecting rooms: <https://docs.mau.fi/meowlnir/bot-config.html>.

If you have questions that aren't covered by the docs or the help command, you can:

* Ask in the general Asgard chat [#general:asgard.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#general:asgard.chat)
* Ask in the official Draupnir room [#meowlnir:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#meowlnir:maunium.net)
