# Getting started

After your request for a Draupnir bot is approved, start a direct chat with
[@draupnir-main:asgard.chat](https://matrix.to/#/@draupnir-main:asgard.chat).
The bot will reject the invite and invite you to a new management room with
your own Draupnir instance. The user ID of your Draupnir will be of the form
`@draupnir_<uuid>:asgard.chat`.

After joining the management room, see the other pages under Draupnir in the
sidebar for basic usage instructions. You can use `!help` to see a full list
of commands.

If you have questions that aren't covered by the docs here or the help command,
you can:

* Read the [official Draupnir docs](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/setting-up-and-configuring)
* Ask in the general Asgard chat [#general:asgard.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#general:asgard.chat)
* Ask in the official Draupnir room [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org)
