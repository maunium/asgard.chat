# Draupnir for all

This is the Draupnir section of the asgard.chat docs.  

Here you will find instructions for how to request and use your very own Draupnir moderation bot.  
This only covers the absolute basics to get you started quick.  

For a complete list of available options, you can always run the `!help` command in your bot room and read the documentation there.


If you still have open questions afterwards, you can:  
* Read the [official Draupnir docs](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/moderator/setting-up-and-configuring) 
* Ask your question in the asgard.chat general room [#general:asgard.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#general:asgard.chat)
* Ask your question in the official Draupnir room [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org)

# Getting a bot

You can request your own bot by joining the [#general:asgard.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#general:asgard.chat) room on matrix and asking for it.  
Please add some info about the number and size of rooms that you want to use the bot for.  
### (note that this is not a professional enterprise with 24/7 staff, so it may take a bit until you get a response)  

After you made the request, please wait until someone gets to you and confirms that you are approved.  
Once that is done, you can send a invite to a DM to `@draupnir-main:asgard.chat`, the bot will reject it and instead invite you to your new management room.  

After you accepted that invite, the initial setup is complete ðŸ¥³.
